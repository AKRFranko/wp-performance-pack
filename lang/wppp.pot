"<p><strong>Dynamic loading of translation files, only loading and "

"the complete MO files (e.g. when loaded via <code>load_textdomain</code>) "
"into memory. As a result translation of individual strings is quite fast, "
"but loading times and memory consumption are high. Most of the time only a "
"few strings from a mo file are required within a single page request. "
"Activating translation almost doubles execution time in a typical WordPress "
"installation.</p><p>WPPP uses MO-Dynamic, a complete rewrite of the <em>MO</"
"em> implementation, to speed up translations. .mo files are only loaded if "
"needed. On installations with many translated plugins this alone can "
"dramatically reduce execution time. It doesn't load the complete "
"translations into memory, only required ones. This on demand translation is "
"more expensive than translations on fully loaded .mo files but the "
"performance gain by not loading and parsing the complete file outweighs this."
