"Using dynamic image resizing images don't get resized on upload. Instead "
"resizing is done when an intermediate image size is first requested. This "
"can significantly improve upload speed. Once created the image gets saved "
"and is subsequently served directly. Further improvements include adjustable "
"image quality and usage of EXIF thumbnails for creation of smaller "
"intermediate images (when using this option be aware that EXIF thumbnail and "
"actual image can differ), which improves memory and cpu usage when creating "
"intermediate images. To conserve webspace or for use in testing environments "
"saving of intermediate images can be turned off. This will result in a "
"performance hit as images are resized on each request. Using the caching "
"option and an object cache can reduce this performance penalty."
